Joplin VSCode Plugin provides the functionality to manage Joplin notes within VSCode, including common actions like viewing, editing notes, managing note tags, adding or modifying attachments, internal linking, searching, and more.

Joplin Web Clipper aims to communicate with browser extensions via REST Web API, sharing notebooks, notes, tags, etc. Joplin VSCode Plugin connects to the same REST endpoint, allowing you to view and modify notes without leaving the editor.

## Configuration

To access the Joplin database, we need to connect to the API endpoint opened by Joplin Web Clipper. This means that Joplin must be running and the Web Clipper must be enabled.

> For help on Web Clipper, refer to [Joplin Web Clipper](https://joplinapp.org/clipper/).

To get started, you need to pay attention to two settings.

Authorization Token

- Copy your authorization token from Joplin settings and paste it here.
  **Web Clipper -> Advanced Options -> Copy Token**.

Base URL

- Generally, if you are using the locally installed Joplin Desktop Client, no special configuration is needed. If you are using a remote Joplin service, configuration is required.
  For example, <http://127.0.0.1:41184>
